# Page-View-Time-Series-Visualizer
In this project, I will visualize time series data using line charts, bar charts, and box plots.
I will use Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to visualize a dataset containing the number of page views each day on the freeCodeCamp.org forum from 2016-05-09 to 2019-12-03. The data visualizations will help me understand the patterns in visits and identify yearly and monthly growth.

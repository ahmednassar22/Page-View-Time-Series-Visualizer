# Page-View-Time-Series-Visualizer
In this project, I will visualize time series data using line charts, bar charts, and box plots.
I will use Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to visualize a dataset containing the number of page views each day on the freeCodeCamp.org forum from 2016-05-09 to 2019-12-03. The data visualizations will help me understand the patterns in visits and identify yearly and monthly growth.
<ul>
  <li>I will use Pandas to import the data from "fcc-forum-pageviews.csv". Set the index to the date column.
  <li>Clean the data by filtering out days when the page views were in the top 2.5% of the dataset or the bottom 2.5% of the dataset.
